![RESTful 7 routes](https://images.app.goo.gl/BGyk76WEZiCbCh7U8) 

### What are routes?
Routes are the code that are responsible for listening and receiving requests and then deciding what to send back.

### What is CRUD?
4 basic types of (DB) actions: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

### How this helps?
By following this pattern, you donâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel every time you build a new CRUD app. The routes and method names have already been decided so that you can run the action by directly editing URL !!!
